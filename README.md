# Twitter-Program as doubly linked list

The main task is to create a small Twitter program in C++. For this purpose, small tweets (messages) are read in from the keyboard. These will be date and time into a (double) concatenated list. All previous tweet messages should be displayed after the input.

To make it easier, the task is structured into 3 subtasks.

Task 1.1: Programming a data structure which fulfills the functionality of a doubly linked list of integer values.
list with integer values.
Task 1.2: Reprogramming the data structure from Task 1.1 into a template-based data structure in order to
data structure in order to work with data types other than integer.
Task 1.3: The implementation of the Twitter task using the template data type.
